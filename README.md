# static-website-boilerplate
This repository contains a boilerplate that will be built and improved in each branch to have at the end a production ready static website boilerplate optimized by using Webpack.
This boilerplate uses:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Material Design](https://material.io/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (other branches)

## Part 00 - Base project without npm
This branch hosts the whole source of the website boilerplate that you can view [here](https://jsulpis.github.io/static-website-boilerplate/). This branch exists only to show how to use the included libraires without using npm, so the librairies are in the "vendor" folders in the css and js sections.

However, it is much easier and better for maintenance and distribution if you use npm. Thus, this is what will be used in the next parts. 

### Getting started
You don't need anything to run this website on your machine (for now). Juste clone or download the project and open index.html.
